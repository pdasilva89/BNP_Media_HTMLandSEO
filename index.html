        <h1>Bearings and Their Many Forms</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.industrialheating.com/search?q=bearings">Bearings</a> are what make the world go around. Without them, many modern machines could not exist. And without heat treatment, bearings could not do their job.</p>
       <section id="typesofBearings">
        <p>Bearings take a variety of forms for different types of jobs. They include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Air</li>
            <li>Babbit</li>
            <li>Ball</li>
            <li>Magnetic</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Did you know that the first practical caged roller bearing was invented in 1760? <strong>Caged ball and roller bearings</strong> prevent the bearing elements from rubbing against each other, which causes additional friction.</p>

        <p>Steel developments in the 1800s transformed the manufacture and use of rolling-element bearings. Through-hardened components, as the name implies, have the same hardness all the way through the part. Case-carburized components, on the other hand, denote a hard surface but a softer interior. These bearings are typically case hardened by carburizing the surface followed by a conventional austenitize, quench and temper hardening process.</p>
